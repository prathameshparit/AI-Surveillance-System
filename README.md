1. **Camera Tampering Detection:** This feature uses machine learning algorithms to detect any tampering with the surveillance cameras and sends an alert to the authorities. This helps ensure that the surveillance system is always operational and provides a reliable source of information.

2. **Mask Detection:** In these times of increased health concerns, it is important to ensure that people are wearing masks in public spaces. Our system uses deep learning algorithms to detect if a person is wearing a mask and sends an alert if necessary. This helps promote public health and safety.

3. **Gun Detection:** The ability to detect guns in public spaces is crucial for ensuring public safety. Our system uses machine learning algorithms to detect if a person is carrying a gun and sends an alert as well as an SMS to the authorities. This helps to prevent potentially dangerous situations from occurring.

4. **Long Time Pedestrian Detection:** This feature uses machine learning algorithms to detect if a pedestrian has been standing in the same location for an extended period of time. This can be a sign of suspicious activity, and our system sends an alert if necessary.

In addition to these features, our system is built with robust technologies such as Tensorflow, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Haarcascades are also used in this project to improve the accuracy of our detection algorithms.

We hope that this AI Surveillance System will make a positive impact on the security and safety of public spaces. Thank you for choosing our system.
